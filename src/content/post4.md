Since returning from the UK, Professor WONG Mun On has taken on the teaching responsibilities for the course *Quality and Safety Management in Construction* (Course Code: CIVL7044). This course is designed for students majoring in Civil Engineering and Construction Project Management, aiming to comprehensively develop their skills in quality and safety management for construction projects. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including quality management systems, safety standards, risk assessment, construction planning, site management, and relevant laws and regulations.

In the course, students will not only learn about quality control tools and safety training methods but will also be introduced to the application of advanced technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and point cloud technology. Through case studies, field visits, and internships, students gain valuable practical experience. Additionally, the course emphasizes the importance of documentation management, continuous improvement, and professional ethics, ensuring that students can effectively implement quality and safety management in real-world projects, thereby enhancing project compliance and overall efficiency.

In the classroom, Professor WONG Mun On combines theoretical knowledge with practical case studies, creating an engaging and productive learning environment. He particularly showcased his previous project—*Collaborative Training for Precast Facade Installation using BIM and Multi-user VR*—which not only demonstrates the application of advanced technologies but also highlights the importance of teamwork. Through this teaching approach, Professor WONG Mun On successfully transforms complex theoretical concepts into lively and interesting classroom experiences, greatly stimulating students' interest and active participation.
