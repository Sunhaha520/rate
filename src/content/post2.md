This November, our student, Mark, attended the 24th International Conference on Construction Applications of Virtual Reality (CONVR 2024) in Sydney. The CONVR conference focused on Digital Transformations and Virtual Innovation in Sustainable Development and Net-Zero Environments. Our student has performed an oral presentation about his latest research, which introduces an innovative approach to automate the detection and classification of pavement cracks using UAV-captured imagery and deep learning. The research aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of pavement inspections, contributing to better urban transportation safety and maintenance.
