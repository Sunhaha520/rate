Our research project has been awarded funding from the FDCT-ITP Scheme by the Macau Government. This funding supports our work on enhancing road maintenance through the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advanced technologies. The project focuses on developing an intelligent system for automated pavement disease detection using deep learning and 3D reconstruction. By creating a multi-factor evaluation model and an innovative BIM-based management system, we aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of pavement condition assessments in urban infrastructure.
