        "I am a PhD student. My expertise lies at the interface of civil engineering, construction management, and information science. I completed my undergraduate and master's studies in Xi'an, Adelaide, and Macau. During my graduate studies, I served as a teaching assistant for courses including research methods and ethics (STGC8003), steel design (CIVL3000), and structural analysis (CIVL2006).",
        "My current academic work involves fire risk methodologies and applications for heritage buildings and their surrounding environments, including analyzing and managing cadastral and urban information data. My primary goal is to transform complex building and urban data into meaningful insights through advanced spatial analysis and digital modeling, enabling more effective fire safety planning and emergency response strategies."
